Each subdirectory of this directory provides a theme for circulation-related sounds.

The list of themes must be provided in the `audioThemeOptions` constant in
[`CheckoutSettingsForm.js`](../src/settings/CheckoutSettings/CheckoutSettingsForm.js).

Each directory must contain the following files:
* `checkout_error.m4a`
* `checkout_success.m4a`

And should also contain a `README` specifying the provenance of the audio files.
